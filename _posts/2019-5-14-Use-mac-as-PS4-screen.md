title: Use your Mac as a PS4 (Pro) screen!
---

If, like me, you have ever wanted to play your favourite PS4 games while comfortably sitting at your desk and without having the inconvenience of a second screen, you have come to the right place!

Fear no more as the times of having to play on a TV or second screen are over even for us OSX users!

Using your Apple computer as a PS4 screen is just one of those things that requires almost no effort to set up, but is extremely convenient and useful.

But enough chit-chat, let's get to it!

#### **Here is what you are going to need**:

* PS4
* Apple computer running OSX
* DualShock 4 controller
* Usb to micro usb cable (the one used to charge the DualShock controller)

- Standard ethernet cable
- PS4 remote play software
- *(Optional)* an external adaptor to convert ethernet to usb

Now that we have everything that is needed, we can proceed with the set-up!

#### Setting everything up

The first step in connecting your PS4 to your Apple device is to download and install the *PS4 Remote Play* software which can be found at https://remoteplay.dl.playstation.net/remoteplay/lang/en/index.html

This step isn't difficult so I'm going to leave that to you.

---

Now that you have *PS4 Remote Play* installed, it is time to connect one end of the **ethernet** cable to the PS4 and the other end to your Computer as shown in the pictures.

---

Once you have connected your Apple computer to your PS4 it is time to mess with the network settings found in *System Preferences*.
