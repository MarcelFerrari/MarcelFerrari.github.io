### Introduction

Integrating complicated mathematical functions can be really painful and sometimes and sometimes it can impossible to find an elementary indefinite integral (–Hello there $e^{-x^{{2}}}$!–). Luckily there is an other approach to solving integrals: **numerical integration algorithms**.

Numerical integration algorithms allow us to calculate an approximation of the value of an integral with a very good degree accuracy, without having to go through many (and maybe also complicated) steps. Their simplicity is also their strength: since these algorithms only require a few elementary operations (namely $ +, -,\times, \div $) they are often quite fast to compute ()
