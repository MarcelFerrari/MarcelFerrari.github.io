title: Use your Mac as a PS4 (Pro) screen! â€“ Remote play through ethernet cable on OSX!
---

If, like me, you have ever wanted to play your favourite PS4 games while comfortably sitting at your desk and without having the inconvenience of a second screen, you have come to the right place!

Fear no more as the times of having to play on a TV or second screen are over even for us OSX users!

Using your Apple computer as a PS4 screen is just one of those things that requires almost no effort to set up, but is extremely convenient and useful.

But enough chit-chat, let's get to it!

#### **Here is what you are going to need**:

* PS4
* Apple computer running OSX
* DualShock 4 controller
* Usb to micro usb cable (the one used to charge the DualShock controller)

- Standard ethernet cable
- PS4 remote play software
- *(Optional)* an external adaptor to convert ethernet to usb

Now that we have everything that is needed, we can proceed with the set-up!

#### Setting everything up

The first step in connecting your PS4 to your Apple device is to download and install the *PS4 Remote Play* software which can be found <a href="https://remoteplay.dl.playstation.net/remoteplay/lang/en/index.html">here</a>.

This step isn't difficult so I'm going to leave that to you.

Now that you have *PS4 Remote Play* installed, it is time to connect one end of the **ethernet** cable to the PS4 and the other end to your Computer as shown in the pictures.

Once you have connected your Apple computer to your PS4 it is time to mess with the network settings found in *System Preferences*.
