### Hello!

Hello there!

I see your space ship landed on my blog, how exciting!

Here you will find posts about the most random things, ranging from computer science, to video games and art.

I hope you will like what I have to share and that you may, in some obscure manner, find it somewhat useful. :)

### About me!
<p style="padding: 20px;"><img class="card" src="/images/index/me.jpg" style="max-height:350px; border-radius:1000px">



I am an 18 year old student from Ticino in Switzerland. Currently I am working on my high school final project and in a year I will move to ZÃ¼rich to (hopefully) start studying physics at **ETH.**

I am very passionate about a lot of things, <u>some of which</u> are:

* Computer science and science in general (physics, chemistry, ...)
* Robotics (specifically the LEGO Mindstrorms EV3 platform)
* Video games (huge Dark Souls fan)
* Photography and Videography
* Music (I love playing the drums)
</p>
### What am I up to now?

As I mentioned earlier I am currently working on my final high school project in which I try to recreate a study conducted on HIV epitopes which were implanted in a super stable protein called Top7. I will be running some molecular dynamics to simulate said protein and hopefully confirm the aforementioned study by obtaining identical results.
